* checkmate doesn't work
* Playing a specific game and then resetting makes the rules go back to default. Maybe have it reset to 
the specific game config
* login could be better
* UI for timer settings looks weird
* Luis and password is only sign in, maybe have optional sign in
* variations drop down doesn't work
* white space on the boarder of UI
* have player names instead of "w" + "b"
