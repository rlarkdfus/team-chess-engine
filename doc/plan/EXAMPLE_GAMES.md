# Example Games Ooga 

The three games we selected for this project are chess, checkers, and connect 4. These games are similar in the board set-up they all share, but are different in the way each of the pieces are allowed to move. We chose these games because they all share a sort of inherent structure with the idea of the board, but provide an interesting level of complexity when it comes to providing different rules for how each piece will be allowed to move. Each specific game should be able to abstract these complexities in unique ways to combine for an interesting project. 

## Chess 
Chess has the most degrees of freedom in the ways its pieces may move, and are also unique in that the game contains many different pieces with rules about how they move. Kings, Queens, Rooks, Bishops, Knights, and Pawns each have unique limitations on how they are allowed to move, and winning the game is a bit more complex than in some of the other games. 

## Checkers 
Checkers is less complex in the sense that there are only two different types of pieces. Additionally the motion is much simpler. Pieces can move only forward diagonally, except if there is a piece they are able to leap over then, they can continually leap over the pieces to claim them. The other type of pieces are those that have reached the opponents side and are able to move in any direction diagonally. The game is won by capturing all of the opponents pieces. A tie could also be declared by some arbitrary number of moves without a kill. 

## Connect 4 
Connect four is likely the least complex out of these games, as there is only one kind of piece, and every piece is contrained to falling until it reaches the lowermost available position. The game is won by having 4 connected pieces either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
