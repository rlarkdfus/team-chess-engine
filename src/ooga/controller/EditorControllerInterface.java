 * purpose - this class defines the methods that are used in editor mode. This interface extends the
 * controller interface so it inherits those methods that connect the view and model. The methods below
 * are used for adding new pieces as editor mode allows the user to freely add, remove, and move
 * pieces on the board.
 * assumptions - that all the methods below are defined
 * dependencies - this class depends on the editor model, view classes and the boardbuilder classes.
 * To use - The user create a new editor controller object and a default view and model will be created.
 * If a file is selected, the file is sent to boardbuilder and then new view and model objects are
 * created and the game is remade.
