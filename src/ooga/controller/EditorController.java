/**
 * @author albert luis gordon sam richard
 *
 * purpose - this class is a controller type object so it connects the model and view. This specific
 *  subclass is used for when we are in editor mode, which allows for users to freely add, remove, and
 *  move pieces on the board. This is done by calling editor subclasses of the view and model and their subclasses.
 * assumptions - we assume that the defaultConfiguration file is valid. if this isn't the case, the
 *  game will crash.
 * dependencies - this class depends on the editor model classes, the editor view classes, and the
 *  boardbuilder classes.
 * To use - The user must only create a new EditorController object instead of a GameController object
 *  in main.
