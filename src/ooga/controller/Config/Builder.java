 * @Authors Albert
 * purpose - this class builds objects that will be used by the model to run the game. It builds all
 *  the different pieces, and it builds the endConditions that determine when the game ends.
 * assumptions - we assume that the file is a json and formatted with the proper keys. If any of this
 *  isn't there, then we throw exceptions that get caught and sent to the view.
 * dependencies - this class depends on the EndConditionBuilder, the PieceBuilder, and the JsonParser,
 *  and the LocationParser (aka the csv parser)
 * To use - The user will call build() with a File object. Then to get the objects, the user will call the
 *  3 getter methods.
