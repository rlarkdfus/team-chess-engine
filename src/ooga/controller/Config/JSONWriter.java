 * Purpose: JSONWriter is used to be able to save a JSONFile to a specified file path. This will
 * allow for edited preferences of the board and the locations of pieces to be saved to a data file
 * allowing for the continuation of a saved game at a later date.
 * Assumptions: We assume that a properly formatted JSON is passed to saveFile() as well as a
 * filePath that exists on the local computer. We also assume the LocationWriter will effectively
 * write a csv file detailing the states of the pieces.
 * Dependencies: JsonParser
