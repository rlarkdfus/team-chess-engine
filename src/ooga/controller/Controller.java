/**
 * @Authors albert luis gordon sam tarun richard
 *
 * purpose - this class starts the game and connects the board and view, and holds all the game configuration objects.
 *  This is the parent class of editor and game controllers so this class holds all the common methods like
 *  creating the view and model objects, updating the view and model objects, and loading and reading
 *  configuration files. It also resets and quits the game.
 * assumptions - we assume that the defaultConfiguration file is valid. if this isn't the case, the
 *  game will crash.
 * dependencies - this class depends on the model classes, the view classes, and the boardbuilder classes.
 * To use - The user create a new controller object and a default view and model will be created. If a file
 *  is selected, the file is sent to boardbuilder and then new view and model objects are created and
 *  the game is remade.
