 * purpose - the purpose of this class is to manage the board that the controller interacts with.
 * it provides methods for moving pieces and keeping track of game state
 * assumptions - this class assumes that all the pieces are valid, and that the game states are valid.
 * it requires a king for each player.
 * dependencies - this class depends on the PlayerInterface, PieceInterface, Location, and PowerupInterface
 * usage - a board is constructed with a list of players and bounds, and its methods are called
 * such as movePiece and executeMove to update the board's pieces.
